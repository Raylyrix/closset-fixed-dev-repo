# Critical Fixes Applied - Brush Tool Issues

## Issues Identified from Console Logs:

### 1. ✅ LayerSystemBridge `getActiveLayer` Error - FIXED
**Error**: `TypeError: getActiveLayer is not a function`
**Root Cause**: Method doesn't exist in AdvancedLayerSystem
**Fix Applied**: Modified `getOrCreateActiveLayer()` to use `advancedState.activeLayerId` and `advancedState.layers.get()` instead

### 2. ✅ ComposedCanvas Wrong Size - FIXED  
**Error**: ComposedCanvas is 1024x1024 instead of 4096x4096
**Root Cause**: `performanceOptimizer.getOptimalCanvasSize()` returning smaller sizes
**Fix Applied**: Modified LeftPanelCompact.tsx to always use 4096x4096

### 3. ⚠️ Brush Drawing Only Dots - NEEDS VERIFICATION
**Error**: Brush strokes not accumulating, only single dots appearing
**Potential Causes**:
- Layer canvas being drawn to is not the same one in state
- Composition not including brush stroke layers
- Advanced layer system not properly creating brush-stroke layers

### 4. ⚠️ Model Turning Black - RELATED TO #2
**Error**: Model disappears after drawing attempt
**Root Cause**: Empty ComposedCanvas being applied as texture
**Status**: Should be fixed by #2, but needs verification

## Next Steps:

1. **Verify Canvas Initialization**: Ensure ComposedCanvas is always 4096x4096
2. **Check Layer Creation**: Verify brush-stroke layers are being created
3. **Validate Layer Composition**: Ensure brush-stroke layers are included in composition
4. **Test Brush Accumulation**: Verify points are accumulating in strokes

## Files Modified:

1. `apps/web/src/core/LayerSystemBridge.ts` - Fixed getActiveLayer error
2. `apps/web/src/components/LeftPanelCompact.tsx` - Fixed canvas size
3. `apps/web/src/components/UniversalSelection/UniversalSelection.tsx` - Fixed coordinate system
4. `apps/web/src/components/UniversalSelection/SelectionIntegration.tsx` - Fixed text bounds
