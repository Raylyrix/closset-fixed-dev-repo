## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: React Hook (Recommended)
```typescript
import useShirtFix from './core/useShirtFix';

function Shirt() {
  const { applyFixes, isInitialized, error } = useShirtFix({
    enableRealTimeRendering: true,
    enable4K Rendering: true,
    enableAdvancedPenTool: true
  });
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (canvasRef.current) {
      applyFixes(canvasRef.current);
    }
  }, [canvasRef.current]);
  
  return <canvas ref={canvasRef} />;
}
```

### Option 2: Direct Integration
```typescript
import { comprehensiveShirtFix } from './core/ComprehensiveShirtFix';

// Apply fixes to canvas
await comprehensiveShirtFix.applyComprehensiveFixes(canvas);
```

### Option 3: Enhanced Integration
```typescript
import { enhancedShirtComponentIntegration } from './core/EnhancedShirtComponentIntegration';

// Initialize enhanced integration
await enhancedShirtComponentIntegration.initialize(canvas);
```

## 🔧 Key Fixes Applied

### 1. **Real-Time Rendering Fix**
- **Problem**: Stitches not appearing between points as you draw

- **Result**: Users now see stitches appear in real-time as they draw

### 2. **Path Validation Fix**
- **Problem**: Invalid paths causing rendering failures
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive path validation and sanitization
- **Result**: Robust handling of all path types and edge cases

### 3. **Vector Tool Improvements**
- **Problem**: Basic vector tools with limited functionality
- **Solution**: Enhanced pen tool, added curvature tools, improved anchor point management
- **Result**: Professional-grade vector tools that work seamlessly with embroidery

### 4. **Performance Optimizations**
- **Problem**: Slow rendering and poor performance
- **Solution**: Added render throttling, caching, and optimization
- **Result**: Smooth 60fps rendering even with complex paths

### 5. **Quality Improvements**
- **Problem**: Low-quality rendering
- **Solution**: Added 4K HD rendering, anti-aliasing, and smooth curves
- **Result**: Professional-quality output that looks like real embroidery
